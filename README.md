Subnetter is a lightweight, browser-based tool for practicing IPv4 subnetting, including VLSM, with realistic CCNA-style questions.

It generates random subnetting problems, enforces proper largest-to-smallest allocation, and checks your work against correct address-block math. When you miss something, it shows the correct values and explains where things went wrong so you can learn from the mistake instead of guessing.

The app is fully static, runs on GitHub Pages, and requires no backend, accounts, or calculators.

## Why this exists
Subnetter was built to practice subnetting the way it’s expected on exams and in real work—by understanding the math, not memorizing shortcuts.
